## Week 2B ----------------------

Overall, great start! A few small changes:

- Make sure you are properly indenting your code. It makes it difficult to read and understand when the code is poorly indented. The Indent Rainbow plugin will flag improper indentation red to help you
  - It looks like you have your Tab Size in VS Code set to 8, which is very large. I would set it to either 2 or 4 at max
- the <h1> should be wrapped around the <img> inside the <header>
- You should avoid typing in all caps on the web, it is bad for accessibility. Right in normal sentence case and then we can style it later with CSS to make it all caps.
- the "Design your brand..." heading should be an <h2>
- The logos in the header/footer should be wrapped in an <a> linking to the home page
